# Week 4 workshop: Recursion in Python

This week, you will work on the exercises in the notebook `recursive_det.ipynb`.

As you'll be **pair programming**, choose one of you to be the driver first; then, every 15 minutes or so, **swap roles**. The driver writes code and shares their screen, the navigator is an active observer/helper.
